	<h1>Wrestling</h1>
<p>Wrestling is a physical sport. It involves 2 compettetors and a referee. There are 3 periods in wrestling.  The first period is 1:30, the seond is 1:00, and the third is 1:00.  These are the times for middle school wrestling.  Highschool wrestling times are longer. There are many wrestling teams you can join, and you can learn many moves and become really good.  A few common moves for beginners are the double leg takedown, the single leg takedown, the snapdown, spin behind, and the half nelson.  Some moves for more advance wrestlers are the double grapevine, the arm bar, and riding legs.</p>
<br>
<h4>Equipment</h4>
	<br>
<p>The gear required for wrestling isn't a lot.  One participating in wrestling will need wrestling shoes, a singlet, and headgear. You need to wear wrestling shoes because regular sneakers taer up the mat. Wrestling headgear is a necessity because when your ears rub on the mat, they can fill with fluid and hearden, turning into really, ugly coliflower ears. Once the fluid hardens, you will need surgery to make them return to normal.  You can buy any of these items at Sports Authority.</p>
<br>
<h4>The Objective</h4>
<br>
<p id="middle">The objective of wrestling is simple.  You can either try to pin your opponent or win by scoring more points.  You score 2 points for a takedown, 2 points for a reversal, 1 for an escape, and either 3 or 2 points for backpoints. </p>
